# craigbampton-TomIrvine-python3x-port

This project is an attempt to port the matlab script files published by Tom Irvine in his website https://vibrationdata.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/craig-bampton-method/
The scripts let the user define and assemble mass and stiffness matrices for multiple 1D spring mass systems. These matrices are subjected to a model order reduction method called the Craig-Bampton method, which reduced the matrices to save computational cost
This is only a demonstration of the problems presented in Tom Irvine's website.
